# ____ chess ____ ?

I'm a [below average chess player](https://www.chess.com/member/persist32), with above average enthusiasm about chess. 

The 2 goals of this project are: 
   
1. To answer interesting questions chess related questions. 
2. To practice and improve my python programming skills. 

To address this, I use python to analyse [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/) data and answer the following questions: 

| No. | Question | Blog | Jupyter Notebook |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 01 | How has *The Queen's Gambit* impacted the popularity of online chess? | [blog](https://medium.com/@dzhang32/how-has-the-queens-gambit-impacted-the-popularity-of-online-chess-43594efe5a98) | [jnb](https://github.com/dzhang32/chess/blob/main/01-queens_gambit.ipynb) |
| 02 | How has *The Queen's Gambit* impacted online chess games? | TBA | TBA |
| 03 | Can I derive insights from my own online chess games to help improve at chess? | TBA | TBA |
    
## Repository structure

Each question will have it's accompanying [Medium](https://medium.com/@dzhang32) blogpost and Jupyter notebook. The source code for some of the longer analyses can be found in [scripts](scripts/). All jupyter notebooks and scripts relating each question will be prefaced with the number associated with that question above (e.g. `01-script_or_jnb_name`). 

## Acknowledgements

This analysis is made possible thanks to [chess.com's API](https://www.chess.com/news/view/published-data-api) and the accompanying [python wrapper](https://chesscom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
