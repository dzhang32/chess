# ____ chess ____ ?

I'm a [below average chess player](https://www.chess.com/member/persist32), with above average enthusiasm about chess. 

The 2 goals of this project are: 
   
1. To answer interesting questions chess related questions. 
2. To practice and improve my python programming skills. 

To address these, I use python to analyse [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/) data and answer the following question.

| Question | Blog | Jupyter Notebook |
| --- | --- | --- |
| How has *The Queen's Gambit* impacted the popularity of online chess? | [blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-has-the-queens-gambit-impacted-the-popularity-of-online-chess-43594efe5a98) | [jnb](https://github.com/dzhang32/chess/blob/main/01-queens_gambit.ipynb) |

## Repository structure

Data wrangling and plotting code is found in the jupyter notebooks and longer, API-querying jobs are located in [scripts](scripts/).

## Acknowledgements

This analysis is made possible thanks to [chess.com's API](https://www.chess.com/news/view/published-data-api) and the accompanying [python wrapper](https://chesscom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
