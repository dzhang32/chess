# ____ chess ____ ?

Here, I use python to analyse [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/) data to answer interesting chess-related questions. I'll tackle questions ranging from how the Queen's Gambit impacted online chess to looking through my own games to try to improve at chess. 

## Acknowledgements

This kind of analysis is made possible thanks to [chess.com's API](https://www.chess.com/news/view/published-data-api) and the accompanying [python wrapper](https://chesscom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
