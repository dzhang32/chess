# ____ chess ____ ?

I'm a below average chess player, with above average enthusiasm about chess. The 2 main goals of this project are: 
   
    1. Answer some interesting questions related to chess. 
    2. Practice and improve my Python programming skills. 

To this end, I use python to analyse [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/) data to answer the following questions: 

    1. How has *The Queen's Gambit* impacted the popularity of online chess [Blog](TBA) [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/dzhang32/chess/blob/main/01-queens_gambit.ipynb)
    2. How has *The Queen's Gambit* impacted the nature of online chess play.
    3. Deriving insights from my own chess games. 
    
## Repository structure

Each question will have it's accompanying [Medium](https://medium.com/@dzhang32) blogpost and Jupyter notebook. The source code for some of the longer analyses can be found in scripts. All the jupyter notebooks and scripts relating each question will be prefaced with the number associated with that question above (e.g. `01-script_or_jnb_name`). 

## Acknowledgements

This kind of analysis is made possible thanks to [chess.com's API](https://www.chess.com/news/view/published-data-api) and the accompanying [python wrapper](https://chesscom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
